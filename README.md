# Magic Eden Sniper

## Getting Started
To get started, create a file named `./bot/.env` with the following environment variables:

```shell
# These are the environment variables required for sniping

USER_KEY=
RPC=
COLLECTION_NAME=

```

The API fetches the latest floored NFTs and sends the data to the client. Originally built in Python two years ago, some parts of the script may still function today. With minor updates, it could be fully operational again. This script was originally part of a larger project.
